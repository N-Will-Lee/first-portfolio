            I grew up in the quaint little town of Mounatin View California and have always been interested in technology.<br>  I went to UC Santa Cruz and received a chemistry degree (go slugs!) but after working in a commercial lab in Seattle, I decided chemistry was not for me.  <br>Needing a change, I moved to Marin California and for the last two years have been working as a kayak guide.  I've always been interested in coding and after years of indecidion I decided to pull the trigger and apply to Galvanize.<br>  I now live in Wash park with my brother and spend any extra time I've got climbing and exploring the mountians!
